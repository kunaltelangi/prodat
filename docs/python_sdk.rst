Python SDK
*****************

Datmo's Python SDK is a way to create datmo snapshots and run tasks directly within your code.
Although the SDK is not necessary for using datmo, it helps simplify the process of integrating
your current code with current Python projects. If you aren't using Python, see :ref:`cli`.
