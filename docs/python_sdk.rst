Python SDK
*****************

prodat's Python SDK is a way to create prodat snapshots and run tasks directly within your code.
Although the SDK is not necessary for using prodat, it helps simplify the process of integrating
your current code with current Python projects. If you aren't using Python, see :ref:`cli`.
